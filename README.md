# 🐦 Boids Simulation & Flocking Behavior Visualizer

An interactive simulation of Craig Reynolds' Boids Algorithm, built with Typescript and React, that models the behavior of flocking birds using simple local interaction rules. This project reveals how complexity arises from simplicity, and how the components of flocking behaviour can be condensed into a few main principles.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Emergent Behavior – Watch flocking arise from three simple rules: Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion.
- 🧮 Vector-Based Logic – Each boid calculates its motion in real time based on neighbors’ positions, velocities, and directions.
- 🎛️ Fully Adjustable UI – Use number inputs and buttons to control Boid count, Speed, Trail effects, and Neighborhood radius.
- 📊 Real-Time Visualization – Frame-by-frame updates show how each decision impacts the group dynamically.
- ✍️ In-Line Pseudocode Explanations – Each algorithmic step is annotated to help users understand how the code works.
- 🎓 Educational Tool – Ideal for learners interested in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, or biological modeling.
